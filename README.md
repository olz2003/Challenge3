# Challenge3

## Description

Challenge3 is a web application that allows users to generate random passwords based on their chosen criteria. This project was motivated by the need for users to create strong, secure passwords for sensitive data. The application solves this problem by offering a user-friendly interface where users can specify the length of the password and select which character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters) to include.

### What does this project do?

- Generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria.
- Ensures that passwords meet security standards by allowing users to include a variety of character types.
- Provides a clean and responsive user interface for an optimal user experience.

### What did we learn?

Through this project, we learned how to create a web application that dynamically generates passwords and adapts to different screen sizes. We gained experience in working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a polished user interface and implement user input validation.
